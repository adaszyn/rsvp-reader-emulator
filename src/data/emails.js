  `Larry,
  
  Thank you for getting back with me.  To answer your question:  It is looking 
  more and more like the week of January 8th.  The meetings would be held using 
  approximately 1.5 days of a 3-day window:  the 9th, 10th, and 11th.  I have 
  input from Kim Godfrey, who is driving things on the EBS side, and I have a 
  tentative OK from Avaya for the window of the 9th - 11th.  
  
  I will want to begin getting headcount of the EBS travelers, and the day(s) 
  which each would be attending.  For example, you would probably attend both 
  days, while some of your team would be there exclusively for the 2nd day 
  meetings.  I'm not sure Jim Crowder would be at both days, but Kim G. 
  certainly would, as would members of her origination team, including Systems 
  Engineer(s).
  
  I will call you this week to get your input re:  who from your team would be 
  going, and for which days.
  
  Thank you,
  
  Jeff`,

  `Jim, 
  
  I have spoken w/Nancy Young, and we have penciled in 
  that you could possibly make the trip on December 19th, 
  20th, or 21st; OR January 9th, 10th, or 11th.  If Larry and Everett 
  can also join on one of the same days you are penciled in 
  for, I would like to book your time for the meeting.
  
  Larry,
  
  I have left you a voicemail, and this note.  Please let me 
  know ASAP which of the days that I have penciled in for 
  Jim Crowder's attendance would also work for you.
  
  Everett,
  
  I have called Marie Thibaut and left her the information on 
  her voicemail.  Since she's out, I'll send this to you directly, 
  as well.  Will you also let me know which days (above) 
  work best for you?
  
  Steve Pearlman, 
  
  You and I have spoken, I have your availability info.  Thank you.

  `Thad, can you give Barbara a "hold" on this until you and I get the 
  people scheduled?  I have just returned from a day off, and don't 
  have the information I needed yet.  It still looks like Jan 8-9 may be 
  leading date candidates, with the 19/20 or 20/21 of December being 
  possible alternates...
  
  Thank you,
  
  Jeff`,
  `Jennifer, 
  
  I hope James is getting the treatment he needs to get on the way back to 
  normal!
  
  As you can see below from the reply from Serge Minassian's AA, it would 
  appear that the note I 
  sent to Thad on the 21st hadn't been used to successfully transfer the info 
  to Barbara...I will 
  now call Kim Godfrey back (I was waiting on this response from Ms. Korp, so I 
  could better know 
  the Avaya Execs' calendars' status).
  
  I'll talk w/you later...
  
  Jeff`,
  `Barbara,
  
  I do not know if you received a "heads-up" on this,
  but since you are working with Executive calendars and the
  Briefing Center resource, I wanted to make sure you had it.
  Better safe than sorry, especially with the recent holidays.
  
  Thad White and I agreed that in order to properly simplify
  the communications channels between our organizations,
  that he and I should be the primary points of interconnection
  for this particular project and these meetings.  I apologize that
  I do not have the calendar availability of the various Enron
  Broadband Services executives, but given the opportunities
  of having meetings in Basking Ridge either:  (for 1.5 days of a
  3 day period) December 19 - 21, 2000 or January 9 - 11, 2001;
  the (tentative) preference leanings are toward rescheduling
  the currently proposed dates of December 13/14 to the
  January 2001 dates.
  
  I will keep Thad posted, and he will keep you posted.  I
  apologize for any delays or confusion, if any, but I will
  periodically check in with you as well, to make sure we're
  all on the same path.  My primary communication focus will
  be Thad, however, in order to minimize any confusion.
  
  Thank you,

  `Jeff,
  
  I'm in the process of booking the Avaya Briefing Center and need to know
  how
  many people from Enron will be visiting our headquarters.  I've asked for
  the afternoon of December 13th and all day on the 14th.
  
  Barb`,
  `Barbara, et. al.:
  
  After a flurry of phone calls, in which both Jennifer Stewart
  and I have spoken with Serge Minassian, the following dates
  look like the most likely targets:  for the 1st day (half-day session),
  Wednesday, December 13.  For the 2nd day (full-day session),
  Thursday, December 14th.
  
  Serge has indicated his availability for a 2-hour block of time,
  on the 13th in the afternoon.  That meeting would be essentially
  an executive overview and strategy session for the appropriate
  Avaya executives and the Enron Broadband Services exec-
  utives.  The bulk of that meeting would be EBS' presentation
  of their Value Proposition for the potential EBS/Avaya efforts.
  
  The second day would be for members of Avaya's engineering
  and development organizations, and possibly marketing; to
  have a full day to meet with the equivalent EBS team.  Both
  software/firmware and product platform-type of concepts would
  be examined, and any other area in which EBS and Avaya
  development folks felt that there were possible synergies for
  a solution or solutions for the following 2 primary areas:
  
  1)  "sell to":  EBS solutions to Avaya for internal use, and
  2)  "sell through & sell with":  EBS and Avaya possibly
  developing a solution for bringing to market in a similar
  fashion to the Avaya/Siebel Systems' efforts.
  
  By way of copying this to the EBS team, I am asking that
  they will coordinate with me whom they would be sending,
  and to make sure that the 13th/14th of December fit into
  the appropriate calendars.  If there are any Avaya questions
  related to development/engineering efforts, I would coordinate
  as well, and most likely route to Larry Ciscon, or other EBS
  engineering/development executive(s), as appropriate.
  
  Thank you again for your help, and we look forward to the
  opportunity!
  
  
  Jeff Youngflesh`,

  `Jeff & Thad,
  
  I spoke with Serge this afternoon.  He definitely wants to meet with Enron
  as soon as possible, but only for a maximum of two hours.  Two members of
  his team will participate, Wayne Sam and Edward Chang.  I will coordinate a
  date with them and send a message of available days and times.
  
  If you have any questions, do not hesitate to call or write.

   I received the rent roll.  I am going to be in San Marcos this weekend but I 
  am booked with stage coach.  I will drive by Friday evening.
   I will let you know next week if I need to see the inside.  Can you find out 
  when Chelsea Villa last changed hands and for what price?
  
   What about getting a look at the site plans for the Burnet deal.  Remember 
  we have to get Brenda happy.

The kids are into typical toys and games.  Justin likes power 
  ranger stuff.  Kelsey really likes art.  Books would also be good.  
  We are spending Christmas in Houston with Heather's sister.  We 
  are planning to come to San Marcos for New Years.  
How long will you stay?  what are your plans?  Email me with

  `Hi All,

I would be greatful if you could get to me today via e:mail a job description for your current role.  I would like to get this to the immigration attorneys so that they can finalise the paperwork in preparation for INS filing once the UBS deal is signed.

Kind regards,

  `Not sure if you guys were aware of this.  I heard that Tractebel was unwinding a lot of their positions over the last couple weeks, and that the PSC shot the deal down (yesterday i think).

  `Casey,
 
 I have requested a Security Form from Laura Bacon for the additional Stack ID.  Once I receive, I will forward it to you.  Please fill out and have signed by appropriate signatory then return to Corporate Security.  If you will let me know when the form has been returned to Corporate Security, I will follow up with them as to when the ID has been set up.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Stephanie x33465`,
  `Casey,
 
 Using one login ID, Bob can open two seperate Stack Manager windows on two PCs and set up different product filters on each for purposes of managing his different regions. The only drawback here is that whichever stack he closes last will save the product defaults and he will have to set up his seperate breakout for the other region each time he logs in (a proces that may take a minute or two depending on how many products he is managing).
 
 To avoid this, we could set him up with a second Stack Manager ID and he could simply maintain two distinct stacks. If he would like a second Stack Manager ID, just let me know and I will forward the request to Stephanie Sever for setup.
 
 Thanks,
 Torrey`,

 Torrey,
 
 Rob Benson is currently trading two general power regions (PJM and New York) under one EOL ID.  He manages one stack manager of which all deals are mapped to his EPMI-LT-PJM book.  He would like to create an additional stack manager so that he can divide the two regions into their own stack and manage them on separate screens.  All of the deals would continue to go into the LT-PJM book.  Let me know if this would be doable and what I need to do on my side to help out.
 
 Thanks!
 Casey`
